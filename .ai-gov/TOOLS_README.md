# AI Governance Framework - Tools Directory

This directory contains runtime tools and artifacts for the AI Governance Framework.

## Purpose

`.ai-gov/` keeps all runtime artifacts **separate from `.claude/`** to maintain a clean separation:

- **`.claude/`** - Framework definitions only (commands, templates, rules)
- **`.ai-gov/`** - Runtime artifacts and tools

## Contents

### `tools/` - Framework Tools

Python-based tools that support framework commands:

- **`graph-generator.py`** - Extracts code structure into graph model
- **`run-graph-generator.sh`** - Wrapper script for isolated execution
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`venv/`** - Isolated Python virtual environment (created by install.sh)

### `memory.md` - Project Memory

Created by `/gov-memory-init` or `/gov-memory-create` commands.
Contains project context that AI assistants use for understanding the codebase.

### `code-graph.json` - Code Graph Model

Generated by `/gov-graph-generate` command.
Contains structured representation of code elements (files, classes, functions) and their relationships.

## Installation

Tools are installed automatically when running `install.sh`:

1. Framework copies tools to `.ai-gov/tools/`
2. Creates isolated Python venv in `.ai-gov/tools/venv/`
3. Installs dependencies via pip

## Usage

Tools are invoked automatically by framework commands. Users never call them directly:

```bash
# User runs command
/gov-graph-generate

# Command internally calls
.ai-gov/tools/run-graph-generator.sh python .

# Wrapper uses isolated Python
.ai-gov/tools/venv/bin/python3 .ai-gov/tools/graph-generator.py python .
```

## Isolation Benefits

- **No system pollution** - Dependencies installed in isolated venv
- **No user setup** - Tools work immediately after framework install
- **Version control** - venv excluded via .gitignore
- **Clean separation** - `.claude/` remains framework-only

## .gitignore

The following are excluded from version control:

```
.ai-gov/tools/venv/
*.pyc
__pycache__/
```

Project artifacts like `memory.md` and `code-graph.json` should be committed.

# Cleanup Summary - Code Graph Enricher Extraction

**Date**: 2025-10-27

## What Was Extracted

The Code Graph Enricher PoC has been successfully extracted into a standalone package and moved to a separate repository.

### Extracted Files

The following files were part of the standalone package that was moved:

**Package Source** (moved to separate repo):
- `code-graph-enricher/src/enricher/__init__.py`

- `code-graph-enricher/src/enricher/layer1_structural.py`
- `code-graph-enricher/src/enricher/layer2_semantic.py`
- `code-graph-enricher/src/enricher/layer3_domain.py`
- `code-graph-enricher/src/enricher/enrichment_schemas.py`

**Documentation** (moved to separate repo):
- `code-graph-enricher/README.md`
- `code-graph-enricher/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `code-graph-enricher/examples/README.md`
- `code-graph-enricher/PACKAGE-INFO.md`
- `code-graph-enricher/CHANGELOG.md`

**Configuration** (moved to separate repo):
- `code-graph-enricher/setup.py`
- `code-graph-enricher/pyproject.toml`
- `code-graph-enricher/requirements.txt`
- `code-graph-enricher/LICENSE`
- `code-graph-enricher/MANIFEST.in`
- `code-graph-enricher/.gitignore`

**Examples** (moved to separate repo):
- `code-graph-enricher/examples/test-code-data/` (copy of test data)

**Scripts** (moved to separate repo):
- `code-graph-enricher/quickstart.sh`

### What Remains in This Project

**Test Data** (kept in root):
- `test-code-data/` - Sample Python code for testing graph generation and enrichment
  - `main.py` - Entry point with imports
  - `models.py` - Data classes and models
  - `utils.py` - Utility functions
  - Used by `test-install.sh` for functional verification

**Active Tools in `.ai-gov/tools/`**:
- `.ai-gov/tools/graph-generator.py` - Base code graph generation
- `.ai-gov/tools/run-graph-generator.sh` - Graph generator wrapper
- `.ai-gov/tools/requirements.txt` - Dependencies for graph generator
- `.ai-gov/tools/venv/` - Virtual environment

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- `test-install.sh` - Comprehensive installation test script
- `uninstall.sh` - Safe framework uninstall script

**Documentation** (preserved for reference):
- `working-docs/01-memory/iterative-enrichment-poc.md` - PoC design (updated with extraction note)
- `working-docs/01-memory/code-graph-knowledge-extraction.md` - Conceptual foundation
- `working-docs/01-memory/domain-knowledge-extraction-design.md` - Future extraction design
- `working-docs/01-memory/EXTRACTED-TOOLS.md` - NEW: Tracking extracted tools
- `working-docs/01-memory/CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` - NEW: This document

## Cleanup Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Extracted standalone package** - Created `code-graph-enricher/` with complete, distributable package
2. ✅ **Directory moved** - User moved `code-graph-enricher/` to separate location
3. ✅ **Documentation updated** - Added extraction notes to `iterative-enrichment-poc.md`
4. ✅ **Tracking added** - Created `EXTRACTED-TOOLS.md` to track extractions
5. ✅ **Test artifacts preserved** - Base code graph kept, enrichment artifacts removed from test data
6. ✅ **PoC files removed** (2025-10-27) - Deleted original enricher PoC files from `.ai-gov/tools/` as they're superseded by the standalone package
7. ✅ **Integration complete** (2025-10-27) - Framework now installs standalone package automatically via `install.sh`

## Files Removed (2025-10-27)

The following PoC files have been removed as they're no longer needed (superseded by standalone package):
- `enrichment_schemas.py`
- `iterative_enricher.py`
- `layer1_structural.py`
- `layer2_semantic.py`
- `layer3_domain.py`
- `enrich-graph.py`
- `run-enrich-graph.sh`
- `README-ENRICHMENT.md`

## What Remains in .ai-gov/tools/

Only the active graph generator tools:
- `graph-generator.py` - Base code graph generation (still active)
- `run-graph-generator.sh` - Graph generator wrapper
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for graph generator
- `venv/` - Virtual environment (gitignored)

## Integration Going Forward

The framework now automatically integrates both tools via slash commands:

```bash
# 1. Generate base graph (using framework's graph-generator.py)
/gov-graph-generate

# 2. Enrich graph (using installed standalone package)
/gov-graph-enrich
```

The `install.sh` script automatically:
- Installs `code-graph-enricher` package from GitHub
- Makes `enrich-graph` command available in the framework's venv
- Configures both commands for seamless use

## Future Extractions

Potential future tools to extract:
- Domain Knowledge Extractor (when built)
- Code Graph Visualizer
- Graph Query Engine

See `EXTRACTED-TOOLS.md` for tracking.

## Summary

The Code Graph Enricher has been successfully extracted into a standalone, reusable tool. The original files remain in this project for reference, while the new standalone package can be independently developed, versioned, and distributed.

**Status**: ✅ Extraction Complete
**Standalone Package Version**: 0.1.0
**This Project Status**: Preserved for reference, future domain extraction work continues

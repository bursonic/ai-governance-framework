# Code Graph Knowledge Extraction

## Overview
This document explores what knowledge can be extracted from ASL (Abstract Syntax/Structure) graphs and methodologies for leveraging this knowledge in AI-assisted development systems.

## Types of Extractable Knowledge

### 1. Structural Knowledge

**Module/Package Architecture**
- Organization of code into files and directories
- Package boundaries and module groupings
- Hierarchical structure of the codebase

**Class Hierarchies**
- Inheritance relationships
- Composition patterns
- Interface implementations

**Function Call Chains**
- Caller-callee relationships
- Execution flow patterns
- Entry points and public APIs

**Dependency Networks**
- Import graphs
- Circular dependency detection
- Module coupling metrics
- Cross-module dependencies

### 2. Semantic Knowledge

**Naming Patterns**
- Variable/function naming conventions
- Domain vocabulary extraction
- Terminology consistency analysis

**Code Patterns**
- Design pattern identification (factory, singleton, observer, etc.)
- Architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Common idioms and practices

**API Surfaces**
- Public vs private interfaces
- Entry points and boundaries
- External API integration points

**Domain Concepts**
- Business logic entities extracted from names
- Relationship between domain objects
- Core vs peripheral functionality

### 3. Complexity & Quality Metrics

**Centrality Measures**
- Which modules/classes are most connected
- Identification of potential bottlenecks
- Critical path analysis

**Complexity Indicators**
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Depth of inheritance trees
- Function/method size and nesting depth

**Cohesion Analysis**
- How tightly related are elements within a module
- Single Responsibility Principle adherence
- Feature locality

**Coupling Analysis**
- Dependency strength between modules
- Afferent/efferent coupling
- Instability metrics

### 4. Change Impact Analysis

**Blast Radius Assessment**
- If I change this function, what else is affected?
- Downstream dependency identification
- Risk assessment for modifications

**Dead Code Detection**
- Unreferenced functions/classes
- Unused imports
- Orphaned modules

**Hot Spots Identification**
- Frequently modified areas (when combined with git history)
- High-churn code regions
- Technical debt accumulation zones

## Knowledge Extraction Techniques

### Graph Queries & Algorithms

**Traversal-Based Queries**
```
Examples:

1. Find all classes that inherit from BaseClass
   - Method: Follow "inherits" edges from source node
   - Use case: Understanding class hierarchies

2. Find all files that depend on module X
   - Method: Traverse "imports" edges backwards
   - Use case: Impact analysis, refactoring safety

3. Identify tightly coupled modules
   - Method: Connected components, community detection
   - Use case: Architecture refactoring, modularity improvement

4. Find critical nodes (removing them breaks many paths)
   - Method: Betweenness centrality, PageRank
   - Use case: Identifying architectural bottlenecks
```

**Graph Algorithms**
- Shortest path: Understanding minimal dependency chains
- Strongly connected components: Finding circular dependencies
- Topological sort: Build order, initialization sequence
- Maximum flow: Data flow analysis

### Pattern Matching

**AST Pattern Queries**
- Find all functions with specific structures (e.g., try/catch blocks)
- Identify security-sensitive code patterns (e.g., eval usage)
- Locate error handling patterns
- Find database query patterns

**Relationship Pattern Detection**
- "Find all classes that implement an interface and call external APIs"
- "Locate all factory methods that create domain objects"
- "Identify observer pattern implementations"

**Naming Pattern Analysis**
- Extract domain vocabulary using NLP on identifiers
- Detect naming convention violations
- Build project-specific terminology dictionaries

### Graph Embeddings & Machine Learning

**Node Embeddings**
- Convert functions/classes to vectors (similar to word2vec for code)
- Preserve structural and semantic properties
- Enable algebraic operations on code entities

**Similarity Search**
- Find structurally similar functions
- Locate duplicate or near-duplicate code
- Suggest refactoring opportunities

**Clustering**
- Group related functionality automatically
- Discover implicit module boundaries
- Identify feature clusters

**Anomaly Detection**
- Find unusual code patterns that might indicate bugs
- Detect architectural violations
- Identify security vulnerabilities

## Practical Use Cases

### For Human Developers

**1. Onboarding**
- "Show me the most important classes to understand first"
- Generate learning paths through the codebase
- Visualize architectural overview

**2. Refactoring**
- "What's safe to change without breaking everything?"
- Calculate change impact scores
- Suggest refactoring boundaries

**3. Code Review**
- "This change affects 47 downstream functions - are you sure?"
- Automated dependency impact reports
- Risk assessment for PRs

**4. Documentation**
- Auto-generate architecture diagrams
- Create dependency maps
- Generate API documentation from structure

### For AI Agents

**1. Context Retrieval**
- "I need to modify authentication - fetch all related code"
- Intelligent context window filling
- Relevant code snippet extraction

**2. Impact Assessment**
- Before suggesting changes, analyze dependencies
- Predict test coverage needs
- Estimate refactoring effort

**3. Code Generation**
- Understand existing patterns to match coding style
- Follow architectural conventions
- Generate consistent code

**4. Bug Fixing**
- Trace execution paths to find root causes
- Identify related bug fixes
- Suggest likely problem areas

## Integration with Knowledge Management Systems

### Vector Databases (ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate)

**Storage Strategy**
- Store embeddings of code nodes (functions, classes, modules)
- Include metadata: name, path, type, complexity metrics
- Combine code structure with documentation embeddings

**Query Capabilities**
- Semantic search: "Find code that handles user authentication"
- Similarity queries: "Find functions similar to this one"
- Multi-modal search: Combine code + comments + docs

**RAG Integration**
- Retrieve relevant code context for LLMs
- Hybrid search: keyword + semantic
- Re-ranking based on graph structure

### Graph Databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB, DGraph)

**Schema Design**
- Nodes: Files, Classes, Functions, Methods, Variables
- Edges: imports, contains, calls, inherits, uses

## Knowledge Extraction Pipeline

### Phase 1: Graph Generation
1. Parse source code (AST generation)
2. Extract nodes (files, classes, functions)

2. Extract semantic information (naming patterns)
3. Generate embeddings for code entities
4. Link with version control data (git blame)

### Phase 3: Storage
1. Persist graph structure to graph DB
2. Store embeddings in vector DB
3. Save metrics and metadata to relational DB
4. Create indexes for fast retrieval

### Phase 4: Query & Retrieval
1. Natural language query parsing

## Next Steps & Questions

### Immediate Priorities
1. Define specific use case(s) to optimize for
2. Choose storage backend(s)

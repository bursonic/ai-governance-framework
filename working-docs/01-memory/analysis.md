## Scope: Project Metadata Only

This phase focuses ONLY on high-level, generalized information about the project.

**In Scope (Metadata):**
- Project identity and purpose
- Technology stack and tools
- Project structure and organization
- Development workflow basics
- Team conventions at high level

**Out of Scope (Domain & Implementation):**
- Business logic details
- Domain models and entities
- API specifications
- Database schemas
- Concrete implementations
- Code-level patterns

Domain knowledge and implementation details will be handled by separate structures and storage in later phases.
